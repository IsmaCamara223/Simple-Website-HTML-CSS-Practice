  <h2 class="colorheader">Prescription Glasses</h2>
  <br>

  <p>When people talk about glasses, the first thing they refer to is probably prescription glasses. These are the glasses with lenses that correct your vision, to help nearsighted and farsighted individuals to see clearly.</p>

  <br>
  <br>

<h3>Bifocals</h3>

<br>

<p>Bifocals glasses are a type of glasses with lenses divided in two zones and correct vision in two ways. The top part allows you to see far and the bottom part to see and read closer.</p>

<h3>Trifocals</h3>

<br>

<p>Trifocals are glasses with lenses that have three zones built in for different kind of vision correction. In addition to the correction in bifocal lenses, they have a zone for intermediate distance.</p>

<h3>Progessives</h3>

<br>

<p>Progressives are another type of multifocal glasses. Like bifocals and trifocals, they contain more than one zone of correction. However, these zone of correction transition into one another more seamlessly.</p>
